This repo is just a few basic tools I will be creating using the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) to make my reddit experience cleaner and better!

The need to make this arised out of the hundreds of saved posts/comments on my reddit profile, some going back 4-5 years even! I wanted to do clean my saved feed, but did not have the time or patience to go through each and every post/comment, remember what made me save the thing in the first place, extract what I wanted to from that saved bit and then unsave it. Hence, I resolved to using PRAW to extract data from the saved contents and then write them to the local directory.

While building that, I realized that while I was solving the problem of the inundated saved posts, there was also an opportunity to only extract the relevant titles I was interested in, not the entire post/comment itself. This gave rise to a potential Named Entity Recognition based solution.

To-Do: 
1. Code walkthrough.
2. Config file description.
