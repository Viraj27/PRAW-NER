This repo is just a few basic tools I will be creating using the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW)to make my reddit experience cleaner and better!

The need to make this arised out of the hundreds of saved posts/comments on my reddit profile, some going back 4-5 years even! I wanted to do clean my saved feed, but did not have the time or patience to go through each and every post/comment, remember what made me save the thing in the first place, extract what I wanted to from that saved bit and then unsave it. Hence, I resolved to using PRAW to extract data from the saved contents and then write them to the local directory

To-Do: 
1. Code walkthrough.
2. Config file description.
